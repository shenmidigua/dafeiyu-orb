## Summary

Give a vision-capable agent live sight of the host's frontmost application window and thirteen exclusive GUI tools so it can click, type, scroll, drag, long-press, list and open apps, open files and the browser, press hotkeys, wait, and save a screenshot to Desktop and the clipboard, then see the new window in the same tool result. Mount it only when you want that unsandboxed control. Text-only routes skip the first screenshot and refuse the tools. macOS and Windows are the production backends; Linux loads the plugin and fails at execute.

## Use this package

Patch this private overlay onto a running Web composition when you want a dedicated Computer Use agent that operates the real desktop. The overlay adds a system agent preset; GUI tools register in that preset's scope, not on the Host. Installing or patching is the consent gate: the tools never ask per click.

### When to choose it

Choose it when a vision model should drive visible GUI chrome that bash cannot reach, and you want a catalog limited to Shell, web search and fetch, the thirteen GUI tools, `code_agent`, `code_agent_status`, `code_agent_stop`, and `ask_user_question`. Avoid it for ordinary coding sessions, text-only routes, and any host that must not grant Screen Recording, Accessibility, and Automation for Finder. It is not a Skill, not a capability seam, and not part of `dsh-base`. Desktop on macOS and Windows also mounts this overlay as a signed runtime extra so the floating ball can lock a Computer Use session.

### Minimal configuration

`pnpm dsh` already runs through tsx, so patch the source overlay and restart the running `dsh web`. The locator plugin's relative entry is anchored to the patch file, matching the Inspector try path, so the CLI app does not depend on this experimental package:

```text
pnpm dsh web --patch packages/experimental/tool-computer-use/cordis.source.patch.yml
```

Create a new session and choose Computer Use in the mode picker. Existing sessions keep their preset. The deployment default remains `standard`, which does not receive the GUI tools.

After `pnpm run build`, [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) loads the emitted `./lib/preset-root.js` locator the same way.

A custom Loader composition that can resolve the package name may instead mount:

```yaml
- id: tool-computer-use
  name: '@dsh-orb/computer-use'
  config:
    postActionWaitMs: 600
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `postActionWaitMs` | `600` | Milliseconds to wait after a GUI action before inspect and pixel capture |

The table above is the list of accepted config fields.

On macOS, grant Screen Recording to capture, Accessibility to post clicks and keys, and Automation for Finder. Desktop's overlay covers Screen Recording and Accessibility before overlay send; the plugin still fails capture or input with a message that names that TCC right if a right is missing at execute. Finder Automation prompts on first use. Windows captures with GDI and posts input with `SendInput`, both in per-monitor physical pixels, so a position on the screenshot lands on that pixel on every display in a mixed-DPI layout. An elevated target window rejects clicks and typing. Linux still loads, and every backend method then throws `computer-use: desktop control is implemented only on macOS and Windows`.

### The tools

There is no `observe` tool. The first user turn already includes the current frontmost window, and every GUI tool returns the post-action window as native image blocks in the tool result. `screenshot` is an export: it writes that raster to the user Desktop and copies it to the clipboard. The image includes that app's open menus, popovers, and panels. It does not include the Dock, menu bar, other applications (except where they overlap this app's windows), or other displays.

| Tool | Arguments | After the action |
|---|---|---|
| `click` | `screen_index` (0), `position: [x,y]` (0–1000 millifraction by default; overlay pixel sessions use attached WxH), optional `button` (`left`/`right`), optional `count` (1 or 2), optional `modifiers` (`shift` / `cmd` / `option` / `control`, held only for that click) | click, wait, recapture |
| `input_text` | `screen_index`, `position`, `text`, optional `replace`, optional `submit` | click-focus, type, optional Enter, wait, recapture |
| `scroll` | `screen_index`, `position`, `direction` (`up`/`down`), `scroll_level` 1–10 | scroll, wait, recapture |
| `hotkey` | `keys: string[]` | key combo; on Windows, bring the last observed window forward when it is not foreground; system screenshot chords are rejected; wait, recapture |
| `wait` | none | pause 1s, recapture |
| `long_wait` | required `wait_seconds`: 10, 30, 60, or 120 | pause, recapture |
| `screenshot` | none | save Desktop files, copy the window to clipboard, return that window |
| `long_press` | `screen_index`, `position`, optional `duration_seconds` 1–10 (default 3) | left-button hold, wait, recapture |
| `drag` | `start_screen_index`, `start_position`, `end_screen_index`, `end_position` | drag on the attached window, wait, recapture |
| `open_in_browser` | optional `url` (http(s); omit launches the default browser) | `/usr/bin/open`, wait, recapture |
| `open_in_finder` | optional `path` (omit = Desktop), optional `reveal_only` | Finder or default app, wait, recapture |
| `list_apps` | none | list running regular apps, recapture |
| `open_app` | `name` (display name or bundle id) | activate or launch, wait, recapture |
| `code_agent` | `task`, optional `session_id`, optional `cwd` | enqueue on a first-class standard session and return that `session_id`; a plugin notice follows after both sessions are idle |
| `code_agent_status` | none | list this Computer Use chat's background sessions (count, latest task, cwd, running or idle) |
| `code_agent_stop` | `session_id` | cancel that session's running turn and queued follow-ups; the session stays idle and continuable |

The thirteen GUI tools run exclusive HID: sibling calls in one step execute in model order and each recaptures. `presentCall` is generic. Each observation starts with `<frontmost_app>` (plus `<frontmost_window>` when the window has a title, `<frontmost_folder>` when Finder or 访达 is frontmost, or `<focus_note>` when no remaining window remains after skipping the overlay, and on Windows also when that window is not the keyboard foreground). The optional screen envelope then names index 0 and that session's click space: millifraction 0–1000 with no pixel sizes, or pixels plus that attachment's WxH. Image-handle dimensions are still not a click space. When no operable window remains, the observation is those tags only — there is no desktop panorama.

Tests inject a fake desktop through `applyComputerUse(ctx, backend, config)` rather than a Config `driver` hook.

On Desktop, omitting `session_id` applies the floating-ball Background Agent Settings when the Host publishes that selection. Passing `session_id` leaves the continued session's model unchanged. Omitting `cwd` mints a unique subdirectory under this Computer Use session's cwd. Other compositions keep the deployment Agent default. Each queued task appends a fixed role the model cannot edit: the background agent does not see the screen; it produces a requested file and replies with the path, or otherwise answers in a few sentences and stops without writing a report. The completion notice quotes the model task only.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design behind the plugin and points at the code that realizes it; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design philosophy

The plugin is one experimental package on purpose. The existing agent-loop already turns a tool result that contains images into the next model request, so Computer Use does not add an observe tool and does not change loop semantics. Grounding copy is a `systemPrompt.section`, not a Skill. A second backend would justify splitting Service Definition from Provider; this cut keeps macOS capture/input in the same package as the tools.

First-frame attachment uses `agent/pre-step`: the listener always awaits `next()`, then appends a plugin `user` notice with `form: 'notice'` when the claimed batch contains a `source.kind === 'user'` message and the route declares image input, except when that user text starts with `Desktop selection. Answer in this chat only. Do not call GUI tools or code_agent.` `agent.inject()` would land only on the next step.

Desktop `code_agent` create reads optional `ctx.get('orbCodeAgentModel')` after `session.create` and before `session.prompt`, passing `saveAsDefault: false`. Continue-by-`session_id` does not. Blank overlay Computer Use creates read optional `ctx.get('orbCoordinateMode')` at `agent/created` and append `'computer-use/coordinate-mode'`; a log with `session/end-seed` or an existing encoding event is left unchanged. Headless/Web omit that service and stay millifraction. This package does not import Desktop Host.

## Model Experience

### System prompt

#### What the model sees

One stable `tool:computer-use` section is assembled on every request while the plugin is mounted. Overlay pixel sessions substitute a pixel Coordinates paragraph; the millifraction text below is the Headless/Web default. On Windows, when the reported window is not the keyboard foreground, the observation adds the Windows unfocused window note, and `hotkey` brings that window forward before posting keys.

##### Computer Use policy

```markdown
Computer Use lets you see the current frontmost application window and operate the GUI.

See: trust only the attached screenshot of the frontmost application on this display for windows, buttons, and on-screen text. The image includes that app's open menus, popovers, and panels. It does not include the Dock, menu bar, other applications (except where they overlap this app's windows), or other displays. Do not assume UI that is not visible in the latest image. You may use observation tags <frontmost_app>, <frontmost_window>, <frontmost_folder>, and <focus_note> as OS metadata.

Coordinates: the attached screenshot uses a 0–1000 space of that window. [0, 0] is the top-left of that image and [1000, 1000] is the bottom-right. x and y scale independently; do not treat the space as a square overlay. Pass position as [x, y] in that space together with screen_index 0. Encode x and y as fractions of this screenshot × 1000 (center x is 500, not a pixel x). Ignore pixel widths and any other image-handle dimensions. Do not send raw pixel coordinates.

Step: you may emit several GUI tool calls in one step when every target is already visible in the latest screenshot and later calls do not need UI that earlier calls create. The host runs those calls in order. Each result includes its own post-action screenshot; after the step, use the last image for any action that depends on what changed. Do not batch a click, type, or hotkey whose target appears only after an earlier action in the same step (menu, dialog, new page, loader).

Do not click or type into a target you cannot see. Do not OCR file paths from the screenshot. When a file or folder path is known, call open_in_finder with that path; do not click Desktop icons to open it. When <frontmost_folder> is present, copy that path; otherwise use bash with real paths. When <focus_note> is present, call open_app to bring the target application forward if the next step needs a window. Do not click chrome that is not in the image.

If <frontmost_app> or the screenshot is not the application the user asked for, call list_apps or open_app. Do not click the Dock; it is not in the screenshot.

Observation is not a tool. After bash, search, or web_fetch, screenshot may refresh the frontmost window. After click, type, wait, or open, do not call screenshot again — those results already attach a window. Call screenshot when the user asked for a screenshot file or needs the image on the clipboard to paste.

This session drives the real unsandboxed desktop. Use bash for a command that answers the user or feeds the next click, including one more command when the first missed. When you are still digging through files or commands, hand that stretch to code_agent. Do not use bash open as a substitute for open_in_finder, open_in_browser, or open_app.

Open a site in the user's visible browser with open_in_browser. web_search and web_fetch return text to you; they do not open a window the user can see.

Drag sliders, window edges, and files with drag. Press and hold with long_press. Multi-select with click plus shift or cmd on each later click; do not hold a modifier across calls.

When the latest screenshot still shows a loader, spinner, or a control that has not appeared, call wait. After click or open, the tool result already has a new screenshot; do not immediately wait unless that image still shows loading. When the screenshot shows a long job still running (download, install, export, or in-window generation), call long_wait with the smallest of 10, 30, 60, or 120 that covers remaining progress. Do not use long_wait for ordinary page load.

Decide each stretch yourself:
- Do it in this chat when it is visible GUI, or when one search or one command will answer the user or feed the next click. A second search that you expect will hit the point stays here. Visible GUI such as opening WeChat or clicking a button in Pages → GUI tools only. Do not call code_agent. A short lookup such as today's weather or current headlines → web_search or web_fetch in this chat. Do not call code_agent or GUI tools.
- Hand the stretch to code_agent when you are still digging through files, searches, or commands. The last step being a click does not keep that investigation here: hand off the investigation, then click after the completion notice.
- A file, document, spreadsheet, or site, such as writing a Word document, a PPT, an Excel file, a website, or a research report (write the report as HTML) → code_agent without session_id.
- Follow-up on the same artifact such as making that Word document's font green, or another stretch of the same investigation → code_agent with the session_id from that earlier result.
- Unrelated new background work such as making a gobang game after the Word document → code_agent without session_id. Do not reuse the Word session.

Working directory for a new code_agent session:
- When the user names a path (Desktop, a home folder, or an absolute path) → pass that path as cwd.
- When the user says "here", "this folder", or "the current window" and <frontmost_folder> is present → pass that folder as cwd.
- When the user says "here", "this folder", or "the current window" and <frontmost_folder> is absent → do not call code_agent. Tell the user the frontmost window is not Finder, so the current folder path is unknown; they should click that Finder window or give a path.
- Otherwise omit cwd; the tool creates a new subdirectory under this session's workspace.

If the user's request names a folder or window that does not match the screenshot or <frontmost_folder>, ask_user_question in this chat. Do not guess. Do not fall back to this session's workspace.

After code_agent returns, tell the user the background Code agent is running. Continue with a GUI action in this turn only when it does not need the background result; otherwise end the turn. Do not call wait, long_wait, or bash sleep to poll that session.

Call code_agent_status when the user asks how many background tasks there are, what they are, where they run, or whether they are still running. Call code_agent_stop when the user wants a background task cancelled. Stopping leaves the session idle; a later code_agent with the same session_id continues that artifact.

When a plugin notice reports that a Code agent session finished, decide again. Do remaining GUI that the result makes possible. If another stretch of file search or file production remains, call code_agent with that session_id. Then tell the user the short conclusion. Do not recite a long report.

When a user message starts with "Desktop selection. Answer in this chat only. Do not call GUI tools or code_agent.", answer in this chat only. Do not call GUI tools, code_agent, or screenshot on that turn.
```

##### Windows unfocused window

```markdown
Keyboard focus is on another window. hotkey brings this window forward first; click inside it if focus must land on a specific control.
```

#### Token effect

Fixed policy cost on every request while the plugin is mounted. First-frame screens and each GUI tool result add image tokens that remain until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the policy text and tool schemas remain unchanged. First-frame notices and tool-result images append after the reusable request prefix. Plugin HMR replaces the section and schemas.

### Tool schemas

#### What the model sees

The model sees `click`, `input_text`, `scroll`, `hotkey`, `wait`, `long_wait`, `screenshot`, `long_press`, `drag`, `open_in_browser`, `open_in_finder`, `list_apps`, `open_app`, `code_agent`, `code_agent_status`, and `code_agent_stop`. There is no observe tool. Text-only routes still receive the GUI schemas and are refused at execute. The `code_agent` family is registered only in the Computer Use preset.

#### Token effect

Fixed schema cost on every request in that tool view.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the sixteen definitions and order are unchanged. Registration lifecycle may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

These limits are current package constraints. The plugin drives the real unsandboxed desktop.

- **macOS and Windows** — capture and HID input run on Darwin and Win32; Linux throws at execute.
- **Screen Recording, Accessibility, and Automation TCC** — capture needs Screen Recording; clicks, typing, scroll, hotkeys, long-press, and drag need Accessibility; Finder folder lookup needs Automation for Finder. The plugin does not prompt. Desktop's overlay cover asks for Screen Recording and Accessibility before overlay `session/prompt`; Finder Automation still prompts at first Finder use. Missing rights at execute still name that TCC. Desktop overlay-exclude capture uses the DeepSeek Orb Screen Recording grant in the Electron process; CLI still spawns `macos-sck-capture`.
- **No per-click approval** — installing or patching the plugin is the consent gate; a visual loop cannot ask on every action.
- **Host chrome is omitted from the shot when it is not the frontmost window** — Web windows appear only when that window is frontmost. Desktop's main window stays capturable when it is next after overlay skip. The macOS overlay and observation-frame ribbon are omitted from Computer Use screenshots by ScreenCaptureKit exclude-id checks (display exclude plus crop) and the overlay is click-through for HID bursts, `open_app`, and their recapture via ack'd overlay-guard IPC. Windows skips those overlay HWNDs in the foreground walk and sets display affinity for the capture interval and for the HID interval that contains recapture. Foreground inspect and `listScreens` skip those overlay window ids, so the main window can appear as `<frontmost_app>`.
- **Typing uses the string clipboard** — `input_text` pastes with Cmd+V on macOS and Ctrl+V on Windows, then restores the previous string clipboard. Windows waits after Ctrl+V before that restore. Other clipboard types are not restored. `screenshot` replaces the pasteboard with the captured image and does not restore the previous clipboard.
- **Retina vs attached size** — backing scale and request rasters can differ from the capture; millifraction sessions pass 0–1000 fractions of the visible screenshot. Overlay pixel sessions divide by that observation's attached WxH named on the Computer Use envelope.
- **Fixed settle wait** — post-action delay is `postActionWaitMs` before inspect and capture pixels; there is no pixel-diff stall.
- **No lasso or `manage_files`** — GUI coverage is click, type, scroll, hotkey, wait, long_wait, screenshot, long-press, drag, open-in-browser, open-in-finder, list-apps, and open-app. Switch apps with `open_app`; do not click the Dock. Background documents and code go through `code_agent`.
- **`code_agent` notice needs live Agents** — execute still returns after queue accept. A missing live Code agent, a disposed Computer Use caller, or a Code session that never returns to idle drops the notice. `code_agent_stop` aborts the watch for that interval. Background Code agents auto-allow approval and auto-answer ask-user prompts; Computer Use itself still shows questions on the ball. Policy cannot stop a model that still calls `wait` or `long_wait`.
- **Desktop overlay** — macOS and Windows create the floating ball. Linux does not. Windows omits the ball from capture with display affinity during capture and HID, and the foreground walk skips the ball's HWND. A non-elevated process cannot click an elevated window. The experimental package is a signed runtime extra, not a Desktop Host npm dependency.
- **Windows keyboard focus** — When the foreground hwnd is skipped, `<frontmost_app>` names the next operable window and the observation adds `<focus_note>`. `hotkey` brings that window forward with Alt plus `SetForegroundWindow` before `SendInput`. When that window does not become foreground, `hotkey` throws `computer-use: keyboard focus could not be moved to <app>; click inside the window, then retry hotkey` and posts no keys. `input_text` focuses by clicking and does not use this restore.
- **Experimental prototype with no stability promise** — the package is private; schemas and backends can change freely.
