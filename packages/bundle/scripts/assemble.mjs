/**
 * Assemble the single installable `dsh-orb` package from the workspace builds.
 *
 * The official loader resolves every plugin name from the profile root, so sub-packages nested inside
 * `dsh-orb/node_modules` are invisible to it. Everything ships inside this one package and is reached
 * through subpath exports: `dsh-orb`, `dsh-orb/host`, `dsh-orb/computer-use`, `dsh-orb/computer-use/code-agent`.
 *
 * Output (all generated, none committed; swapped in atomically so a linked install never sees a partial build):
 *   lib/index.js, lib/index.d.ts   settings page, host half   (from client-settings)
 *   client.js                      settings page, browser half (from client-settings)
 *   dist/host/                     @dsh-orb/host
 *   dist/computer-use/             @dsh-orb/computer-use, including the ScreenCaptureKit helper
 *   dist/helper/                   Electron entry, preload scripts, assets
 *   dist/native-selection/         selection monitor sources and prebuilt library
